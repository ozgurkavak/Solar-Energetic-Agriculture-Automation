Project Name: Solar Energetic Agriculture Automation


The goal of the project:
1) To achieve the maximum efficiency with minimum expenditure, resources and work power in modular transportable and adaptable areas to meet the food problems that come along with increasing population in today's conditions.
2) Be able to respond to the needs of both the manufacturer (ie module manager or owners) and the consumers in time.

Project Details:
1) The project includes agriculture modules which can do all the works of agricultural machines and vehicles that are already used.
2) In addition to the fuel used in agriculture, environmental carbon emissions are being made. Solar energy, which is a free energy source for plants, is going to be used. Thus, agriculture can be done without harming the environment.
3) All processes such as sowing, harvesting, irrigation and maintenance of the products should be planned in advance (planning and preparation of suitable conditions for weather conditions etc. analysis) and control.
4) All these processes will be gathered in the main data management center and processing unit with the help of developer card and environment elements such as Raspberry, Arduino and the necessary commands will be given for the process.

Project Prospects and Projected Benefits:

1) Clean energy is used away from fossil fuel consumption!
Thus, besides agricultural and economic development, environmental awareness will protect nature and leave a cleaner environment for future generations.

2) The increasing cost of fossil fuels and the difficulties in the provision of permanent energy source solar energy will be used away.

3) All processes of the products will be continuously monitored and maximum efficiency will be obtained with minimum loss.
